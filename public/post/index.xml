      <description>Hugo is the bee&amp;rsquo;s knees It&amp;rsquo;s fast
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use
It has cool templates
Alternatives There are other SSGs out there - like Jekyll, Gatsby, and 11ty, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have any experience with them. I suspect they all have their strengths.</description>

      <description>Markdown is really cool It doesn&amp;rsquo;t waste screen real estate.
It&amp;rsquo;s doesn&amp;rsquo;t slow down typing due to having to constantly reach for the mouse.
It provides just enough to get the job done.
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to memorise.
Yes, there are other ways Like keyboard shortcuts often used in rich-text editors. These are handy for those who need them. In an ideal world, they could be turned on or off as required.</description>

      <description>NetlifyCMS is Useful It&amp;rsquo;s great to be able to create a static site and still give site owners a simple means of updating their site.
I see it working best when a &amp;ldquo;skeleton&amp;rdquo; site is created, just from a theme and two or three pages and a blog entry. The CMS would be used to update certain areas on the page and individual blog posts, but not everything.
Time will tell exactly what is possible.</description>
