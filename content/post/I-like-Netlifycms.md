## NetlifyCMS is Useful

It's great to be able to create a static site and still give site owners a simple means of updating their site. 

> I see it working best when a "skeleton" site is created, just from a theme and two or three pages and a blog entry. The CMS would be used to update certain areas on the page and individual blog posts, but not everything.

Time will tell exactly what is possible.
