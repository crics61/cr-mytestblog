## Markdown is really cool

1. It doesn't waste screen real estate.

2. It's doesn't slow down typing due to having to constantly reach for the mouse.

3. It provides just enough to get the job done.

4. It's pretty easy to memorise.

## Yes, there are other ways

Like keyboard shortcuts often used in rich-text editors. These are handy for those who need them. In an ideal world, they could be turned on or off as required.
